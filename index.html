  </center>
  <p>
    &emsp;The My Personal Finance Calculator is a tool designed to educate on personal financial matters, in order to
    help you make more informed financial decisions. Around 80% of Americans have some sort of debt and the goal of the
    calculator is to try to eliminate debt by helping Americans plan out their finances for the next year. The
    calculator considers many components to provide an estimate of how much money you will have by the end of the year.
    The various expenses can be easily changed to see how each will affect the output (earnings or debt). Most of the
    expenses come preset with what the average American would pay. Note this is an average, meaning you may have to pay
    more or less depending on what state you live in and your current circumstances. If you are confused by any of the
    inputs, simply hover over the text and a pop-up will provide insight into what it is along with a link to an
    additional source to further educate yourself. By experimenting with the calculator the user can gain a better
    understanding on how to manage their finances and make more educated decisions on how to spend their money.
